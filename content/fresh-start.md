Woo hoo! I finally had a chance after a busy semester to switch from hosting with Namecheap and publishing with WordPress to hosting with Github Pages and publishing on my own, all thanks to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com).

I initially wanted to get a website up and running for assistance in applying for jobs. That was easily accomplished by hosting with Namecheap and also purchasing the .io domain through them as well (side note: did you know that .io are one of the most expensive domain names?). But with some more time now that the semester is over, I decided that I wanted to build my website from scratch, or as much of it that I could without going insane. As a result, you are staring at a few hours of work and elbow grease that is my personal website!

Now a little background on my URL. If you're not to sure why my URL is *quinntenor.io* instead of *quinntenorio.com* or *quinntenorio.co*, it's because of two reasons:
		
- My last name ends in 'io'
- I am getting a degree in Computer Science (CS) and .io domain names are prevalent in the tech community

So it seemed fitting to purchase the domain as it is. As for the content of this website, I am working on fleshing the details out. It serves two uses, one of which is to represent myself professionally by displaying my resume, talking about projects, etc. The other is to develop it out into a personal site, primarily through the blogging aspect. I plan on discussing many things ranging from technology to constitional law (thanks Professor Levine!) and anything else I want to put my two cents in on.

As for the time being, this article will have to do.
