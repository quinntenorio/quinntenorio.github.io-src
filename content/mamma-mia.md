_Mamma Mia!_ Don't you just love a good dish of spaghetti or ravioli? __Me too__. During my time at Mines studying Computer Science, I took a course called Web Applications (CSCI446) and was able to learn just about everything from front end and back end development, to using different frameworks and using a stack (mainly MEAN). Along the way I had the opportunity to create a front end static website that looked and functioned like a real page that one might see on the world wide web. The purpose was to learn and apply Bootstrap4 knowledge. 

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="../../images/forks-and-spoon-with-wooden-handles.jpg" alt="forks and a spoon on a table">
</div>

As a result, three others and myself created _Mamma Mia!_, a website for a fictitious Italian restaurant nestled into the Rocky Mountains that served wonderful food. At first glance, it looks like a site that a real restaurant would have with a modern touch, beautiful photos of dishes served, a Google Map embedded API for the _fake_ location, a way to reserve a table, and an about page of the restaurant. However, with a lack of back end, there is no real interaction with the page. For instance, the form for the reservation page does nothing, along with the "Use This Coupon" buttons on the home page. Functionality wasn't the key here though, it was the use of Bootstrap4. 

Later on I will be posting about a project built with NodeJS for front end utilizing a MongoDB database for the backend and deployed to Heroku for some full stack functionality. Until then, you can see _Mamma Mia!_ yourself over at [quinntenor.io/mamma-mia](http://quinntenor.io/mamma-mia/).

Enjoy your dish, I hear the tiramisu is great!
