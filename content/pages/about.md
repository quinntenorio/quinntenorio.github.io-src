About Me

My name is Quinn, currently living in sunny Denver, Colorado. I am finishing up my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines with a minor in Computational and Applied Mathematics (aka just Math). I'll be graduating in May of 2019, and I can hardly wait!

I was born and raised here in Colorado, and I am happy to brand myself as a native. While I enjoy coding, I also love to hike around the foothills and also read when I have a chance. I also enjoy spending time with my friends when we can all get a chance to go out. Previously, I have been heavily involved in clubs and organizations taking on roles like Student Body President of Undergraduate Student Government and Publicity Director for the Maker Society. I enjoy having other things to do outside of CS as it helps keep me sane.

My current set up is a 13-inch MacbookAir (2015), iPhone 8 Plus, an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and a backup 13-inch HP Spectre x360 (also 2015). Can you tell I'm kind of a fanboy yet? It all ties into my love for computers.

Unfortunately I don't have any pets, so I can't end this blurb with a picture of my insanely cute dog. Sorry. Enjoy browsing around!
