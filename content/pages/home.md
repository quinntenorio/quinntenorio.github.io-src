My resume is available online and can be downloaded as a PDF file. I also have a new blog where I will be posting more about anything and everything that comes to mind (think technology, constitutional politics, etc.). Feel free to check out my projects page and my Github for projects present and past.

If you have some time (or want to kill some time), check out my time killer page! I have some links there that can help procrastinate and provide some amusement.
